Overview

The SET game is grounded in mathematical and cognitive principles, particularly involving pattern recognition, set theory, and quick decision-making. Each card in SET displays four features: number (1, 2, or 3), color (red, green, or yellow), shading (solid, striped, or open), and shape (ovals, squiggles, diamonds). Players must identify sets of three cards where each attribute is all the same or all different.
The mathematical foundation of SET stems from combinatorics and pattern recognition, and its core challenge is how to efficiently identify valid sets while providing real-time interactive feedback, which is our main goal in realizing the SET game.

Why This Code?

The purpose of this implementation is to offer an educational tool for individuals interested in understanding the mechanics of the SET card game through coding. It is designed for those with a basic background in Python and can be an excellent project for aspiring game developers or programmers.
